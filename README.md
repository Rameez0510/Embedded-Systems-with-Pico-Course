# Embedded Systems with Raspberry Pi Pico W (C SDK) – Course

This repository documents my **hands-on learning journey with Raspberry Pi Pico W** using the official **C SDK**.  
This Repository is made in a course like structure, so that anyone can follow along and learn.
The goal is to move from beginner-level experiments (like blinking LEDs) to real-world embedded systems programming.

## 📂 Course Structure

- `Unit0/` → Environment setup and first blink program  
- `Unit1/` → (upcoming) Embedded Systems Basics + GPIO
- `Unit2/` → (upcoming) Timing & Delays  
- `Unit3/` → (upcoming) Interrupts & Event-Driven Programming  
- `Unit4/` → (upcoming) Displays & Communication with Peripherals (I2C)  
- `Unit5/` → (upcoming) UART Communication (Serial Basics)
- `Unit6/` → (upcoming) Bluetooth Basics (Wireless Comms)
- `Unit7/` → (upcoming) Data Parsing & Buffers
- `Unit8/` → (upcoming) Power Management & Portability
- `Unit9/` → (upcoming) Advanced Peripherals (SPI, PWM, ADC)
- `Unit10/` → (upcoming) Real-Time Behavior & Multitasking

Each Unit has:
- Source code (`.c` files, `CMakeLists.txt`)  
- Build instructions  
- A `README.md` with notes, learnings, and key takeaways

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup
- **Board**: Raspberry Pi Pico W  
- **Toolchain**: ARM GCC + CMake + Make  
- **OS**: Ubuntu Linux  
- **SDK**: [pico-sdk](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk)

## 🎯 Goals
1. Build familiarity with Pico C SDK and low-level programming.  
2. Learn how peripherals (GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI, PWM, etc.) work through hands-on coding.  
3. Document progress with working code examples.  
4. Eventually, create real-world embedded projects on Pico W.
